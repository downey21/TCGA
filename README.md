# TCGA

This repository contains R code for downloading, reading, and preprocessing TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data.

The code demonstrates how to:
- Search for available TCGA datasets
- Query and download RNA-seq expression data

The workflow is mainly based on **TCGAbiolinks** from Bioconductor and **LinkedOmics**.
